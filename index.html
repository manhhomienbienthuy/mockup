    <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>

    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>

    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the
      printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
      industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
      unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
      Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
      recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
      including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>

    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
      by the readable content of a page when looking at its
      layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
      more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
      'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
      English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
      now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
      for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
      infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
      by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
      like).</p>

    <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>

    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
      text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
      45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
      Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
      one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
      Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
      classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
      Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
      Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
      written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
      ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
      Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
      in section 1.10.32.</p><p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used
      since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
      interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
      Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
      original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
      translation by H. Rackham.</p>

    <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>

    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
      but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
      injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
      slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
      Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
      hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
      the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
      making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
      dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
      model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
      reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
      from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
      etc.</p>

    <h3>The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s</h3>

    <p>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed
      do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
      aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation
      ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis
      aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum
      dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat
      cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
      mollit anim id est laborum."</p>

    <h3>Section 1.10.32 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by
      Cicero in 45 BC</h3>

    <p>"Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem
      accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa
      quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae
      vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia
      voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia
      consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi
      nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor
      sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius
      modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat
      voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum
      exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut
      aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure
      reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil
      molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo
      voluptas nulla pariatur?"</p>

    <h3>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h3>

    <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
      denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give
      you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
      teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
      of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
      itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
      know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
      that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves
      or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is
      pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
      and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
      example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
      exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
      any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
      pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a
      pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

    <h3>Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by
    Cicero in 45 BC</h3>

    <p>"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui
      blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos
      dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate
      non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
      mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem
      rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore,
      cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo
      minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas
      assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem
      quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe
      eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non
      recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus,
      ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut
      perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."</p>

    <h3>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h3>

    <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
      dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
      pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
      foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
      blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness
      of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
      and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
      distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
      untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what
      we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
      avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
      duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur
      that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances
      accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters
      to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure
      other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
      pains."</p>
